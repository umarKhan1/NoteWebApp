- [ ] Activity versioning

## Known Limitations & Notes

### Current Implementation
- Uses SharedPreferences (suitable for up to 100+ activities)
- Single device storage (no cloud sync)
- JSON serialization (basic schema)
- Limited to note operations (extensible to other operations)

### Migration Path
- SharedPreferences ‚Üí SQLite (for larger datasets)
- SQLite ‚Üí Firebase (for cloud sync and backups)
- Local storage ‚Üí Server-side tracking (for analytics)

### Extensibility
- Activity types can be expanded (add new enum values)
- Time formatting can be customized
- Icons can be changed (use different emoji or images)
- Service can be extended with new logging methods

## Support Resources

### For Developers
- Read `ACTIVITY_TRACKING_GUIDE.md` for implementation details
- Check `ACTIVITY_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for architecture overview
- Review `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for full feature list

### For Testers
- Follow `ACTIVITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` step-by-step
- Use demo credentials: `demo@example.com` / `password123`
- Verify each activity type appears with correct icon
- Confirm activities persist after logout/login

### For Maintainers
- Keep documentation updated as you make changes
- Run `flutter analyze` before commits
- Add tests for new activity types
- Monitor SharedPreferences storage usage
