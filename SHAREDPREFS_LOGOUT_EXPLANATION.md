# ✅ **Your Question Answered: SharedPreferences + Logout Data Behavior**

## **Your Question:**
> "Data will remain in SharedPreferences when user logs out, right? So the data stays on device?"

---

## **Answer: YES, BUT WITH A CATCH ⚠️**

### **What Happens by DEFAULT:**

```dart
// When user logs out:
Future<void> logout() async {
  // Clear only auth token
  await prefs.remove('auth_token');
  
  // ❌ This does NOT happen automatically:
  // Activities in SharedPreferences still exist!
}

// SharedPreferences state AFTER logout:
{
  'activities': [Activity1, Activity2, Activity3] ← Still here!
  // Activity data persists on device
}

// When next user logs in:
// They CAN access 'activities' key and see previous user's data ❌
```

---

## **Data Behavior By Scenario:**

### **Scenario 1: Single User Device**
```
User logs in → Uses app → Creates activities ✅
User logs out → Activities remain in device ✅
User logs in again → Sees their old activities ✅ (Good!)
```

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Users on Same Device** ⚠️
```
User A logs in → Creates activities A1, A2, A3
User A logs out
  ├─ Activities still in SharedPreferences
  └─ Key: "activities" → [A1, A2, A3]

User B logs in
  ├─ Loads from SharedPreferences
  └─ Sees: A1, A2, A3 ❌ PRIVACY BREACH!
```

---

## **The Solution: User-Specific Keys**

### **With User Isolation:**

```dart
// Before logout (User A):
SharedPreferences = {
  'activities_user_123': [A1, A2, A3]
}

// On logout (User A):
Future<void> logout(String userId) async {
  // Clear ONLY this user's activities
  await prefs.remove('activities_$userId');
  
  // Now SharedPreferences is:
  SharedPreferences = {} // Empty!
}

// User B logs in:
// Loads 'activities_user_456' → Empty ✅
```

## **Question: "Does data remain when user logs out?"**

| Scenario | Default Behavior | With User Isolation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **After logout** | Data remains | Data deleted |
| **Next login (same user)** | Data available | No data |
| **Next login (different user)** | Can see previous user's data ❌ | Cannot see anything ✅ |
| **Security** | Compromised | Protected |

---

## **Practical Example:**

### **Default (Wrong):**
```
Step 1: User A logs in
  → Creates "Secret Project" note
  → Activity saved: {'activities': ['Secret Project']}

Step 2: User A logs out
  → Activity key still in SharedPreferences ❌

Step 3: User A's friend logs in on same device
  → Opens Recent Activity
  → Sees: "User A created 'Secret Project'" ❌ Privacy broken!
```

### **With User Isolation (Correct):**
```
Step 1: User A logs in
  → Creates "Secret Project" note
  → Activity saved: {'activities_user_A': ['Secret Project']}

Step 2: User A logs out
  → Delete 'activities_user_A' ✅
  → SharedPreferences now empty

Step 3: User A's friend logs in on same device
  → Opens Recent Activity
  → Sees: (empty) ✅ User A's data is private
```

## **Code: What to Implement**

### **BEFORE (Current Approach - WRONG):**
```dart
Future<void> saveActivity(Activity activity) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  
  // ❌ Global key - accessible to all users
  final key = 'activities';
  
  List<Activity> activities = [];
  final json = prefs.getString(key);
  if (json != null) {
    activities = (jsonDecode(json) as List)
        .map((e) => Activity.fromJson(e))
        .toList();
  }
  
  activities.add(activity);
  await prefs.setString(key, jsonEncode(activities));
}

// Logout doesn't clear activities
Future<void> logout() async {
  await prefs.remove('auth_token');
  // ❌ Activities still exist in SharedPreferences!
}
```

### **AFTER (Recommended - CORRECT):**
```dart
Future<void> saveActivity(String userId, Activity activity) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  
  // ✅ User-specific key
  final key = 'activities_$userId';
  
  List<Activity> activities = [];
  final json = prefs.getString(key);
  if (json != null) {
    activities = (jsonDecode(json) as List)
        .map((e) => Activity.fromJson(e))
        .toList();
  }
  
  activities.add(activity);
  await prefs.setString(key, jsonEncode(activities));
}

// Logout DOES clear user's activities
Future<void> logout(String userId) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  
  // ✅ Clear auth token
  await prefs.remove('auth_token');
  
  // ✅ Clear user's activities
  await prefs.remove('activities_$userId');
  
  // ✅ Clear other user-specific data
  await prefs.remove('user_preferences_$userId');
}
```

## **TL;DR - Quick Answer:**

```
Q: Does activity data remain in SharedPreferences after logout?
A: YES ✅ (Physical data remains on device)

Q: Can the next user see it?
A: YES ❌ (Without user isolation)
   NO ✅ (With user isolation - RECOMMENDED)

Q: Should we delete it on logout?
A: YES ✅ (For privacy and security)

Q: How do we do it?
A: Use user-specific keys: 'activities_${userId}'
   Then delete: prefs.remove('activities_${userId}')
```

---

## **Why User Isolation is Important:**

```
SharedPreferences is like a notebook on a shared desk:

❌ Without isolation:
   Everyone can read the whole notebook
   └─ Private information visible to all

✅ With isolation:
   Each person has their own locked drawer
   └─ Information stays private
```

---

## **Decision Point:**

### **Single User App:**
- Can use global 'activities' key
- No user isolation needed
- On logout: Optional to clear

### **Multi-User App (Like Yours):**
- ✅ MUST use user-specific keys
- ✅ MUST clear on logout
- ✅ MUST isolate all user data

**Your app appears to be multi-user** → Use user isolation!

---

## **Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Add `userId` parameter to all activity functions
- [ ] Use key format: `activities_${userId}`
- [ ] Clear activities on logout: `prefs.remove('activities_$userId')`
- [ ] Test with multiple users on same device
- [ ] Verify no data leakage between users
